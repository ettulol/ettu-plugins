# ettu plugin

This folder contains the ettu and ettu-update skills, versioned release metadata, and MCP connection configuration. It supports public discovery and existing artwork retrieval, character interviews and version history, status GIFs, permanent universes, main character selection, @handles, follows, story channels, staff proposals and private inbox conversations. Installation does not run the backend or generate artwork.

For new connections, use **Codex** or **Claude Code** and install **ettu** from the **ettu-plugins** catalog. ChatGPT and Claude setup is **Coming soon**; existing connections retain access. The marketplace repository README contains installation commands. Each user signs in with their own ettu account; the image-generation API key stays on the server.

After installation, start a new conversation and ask “Show my ettu characters.” For an explicit Claude Code skill invocation, use `/ettu:ettu`. The bundled skill supplies ettu workflows across projects where the plugin is enabled. It does not make generic character brainstorming publish automatically.

In a built ZIP, inspect `CONNECTION.txt` for the endpoint and package type. The ordinary package has Codex and Claude manifests plus `.mcp.json`. The optional ChatGPT package has an OpenAI manifest and `.app.json` referencing an existing registered connection; it is not a Claude package. A ZIP attached to a normal conversation is not an installed MCP connection.

The bundled endpoint is `https://ettu.lol/mcp`; the website is [ettu.lol](https://ettu.lol). See [maintainer ChatGPT integration notes](https://github.com/ettulol/ettu-plugins/blob/main/docs/chatgpt.md) for registered connections and [the MCP contract](https://github.com/ettulol/ettu-plugins/blob/main/docs/mcp/README.md) for tool schemas and behavior. Installation requires no Python scripts or local server process. Neither package includes account tokens, backend source or private character data.

## Updates

Ask “Check for ettu updates”, or use `/ettu:ettu-update` in Claude Code. The update skill reads this installed bundle's [release.json](release.json), checks the latest release, summarizes newer changes and guides your host's updater. The read-only MCP tool `check_ettu_update` can perform the version comparison. If the tool is unavailable, the skill checks the public release metadata directly. Network or permission failures are reported as unverified checks.

The bundle version is 0.13.53. Both skills, both client manifests and `release.json` update together through the plugin manager. The remote service updates separately. Checking is not installing; after installation, a reload or new conversation may be needed. See [host-specific instructions](skills/ettu-update/references/update-host.md).

## Character limits

Names allow 1–100 characters. Favorites and hates each allow 3–50 distinct items (case-insensitive), up to 120 characters per item. Updates retain existing interest order and append new interests. The detail page shows the latest six and lets visitors expand the rest.

## Episode videos

Ask your AI to animate an episode after adding scenes and published cast. New video prompts allow dialogue, scene ambience and action sounds, with no background music or score. The director can request a new video, inspect generation progress and previous versions, and publish a selected completed video. Episodes start as drafts; publishing a channel does not expose unfinished episodes. The channel page opens on Watch. Studio shows one of Story, Video or Activity at a time, with one video-version selector for earlier plans and reports. Channel cards use the latest published episode’s reviewed first video frame as a thumbnail, without an extra AI call. See [episode video workflows](skills/ettu/references/channels.md#animate-and-publish-episodes).

## Character drafts and publication

Creating, updating or restoring a character leaves a private draft. Open its profile while signed in as its creator to see generation progress, a first content-reviewed frame while work continues, the finished private artwork or a failure reason. New character artwork starts with a medium-quality 1K transparent portrait for owner approval. Only approval of that exact image queues the high-quality 2K eight-view sheet and 768px GIF; the final portrait remains the approved 1K image. Use get_character_image to inspect it, regenerate_character_image for a requested redraw, or confirm_character_image to approve. The app displays transparent artwork against yellow. In version details, choose **I like it!** to approve that picture and start its animation, or **Try another look** for a new picture. Character details, downloads and version management sit in expandable sections. When the artwork is ready, ask your AI to publish the latest version with `publish_character`. Only published versions appear to others and can join channels; an existing public version remains visible until you publish its replacement. Preview links expire after 15 minutes and can be refreshed without generating again.

## Public browsing and artwork

Ask to browse Home or search characters, channels and episodes together, inspect a public character or creator profile, or list a creator’s published characters. Use `list_character_channels` for the public channels featuring a character in published episodes, with previews and episode links ordered by the latest appearance. Request a character portrait or sprite through `get_character_artwork`; PNGs can appear directly in the assistant and include original download links. GIFs and manifests use links. Published artwork follows the published version; explicit versions and never-published artwork are owner-only. Reading artwork does not generate or publish anything.

Whole-character deletion requires the exact current name and explicit confirmation, including deleting the final private version. The server checks ownership, concurrent changes and channel or episode references.

## Branding

The plugin and both skills include the yellow ettu dot icon. The public image is [ettu icon](https://ettu.lol/brand/pwa-512.png); bundled copies load through relative paths without an image request to the website. Keep `assets/` and each skill's `agents/` and `assets/` folders when importing the plugin. Supported hosts use this metadata for branding; actual placement is controlled by the host.

Creator controls: use **Change status** beside the status on an owned character’s profile to choose a mood or **Draw again** for a new animation. Uncertain redraws offer **Check request**, and full failure details sit under **What happened?**. Assistants use `set_character_status` with `regenerate_animation: true` and a fresh UUID `request_key` for a requested redraw; repeat the same key after an uncertain result. The previous approved GIF stays visible while replacement art generates. Failed sprite versions also offer private **More options → Review generated frames**; MCP owner reads accept `include_generated_frames: true`. Content review and publication checks still apply.
